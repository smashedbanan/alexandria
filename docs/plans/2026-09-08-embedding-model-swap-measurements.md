# Embedding model measurements (2026-09-08)

Corpus: 143 active facts from the live database. Questions: 12, listed below.

| model | mean_rank | top1 | mean_gap | hit_min | hit_max | nonhit_p50 | nonhit_p90 | nonhit_p99 | ff_p50 | ff_p90 | ff_p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 1.42 | 9/12 | +0.148 | 0.338 | 0.667 | 0.077 | 0.212 | 0.373 | 0.130 | 0.298 | 0.562 |
| sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L6-cos-v5 | 12.58 | 6/12 | +0.000 | 0.119 | 0.583 | 0.173 | 0.295 | 0.400 | 0.230 | 0.375 | 0.561 |
| sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 | 2.33 | 8/12 | +0.091 | 0.318 | 0.635 | 0.082 | 0.215 | 0.375 | 0.125 | 0.290 | 0.568 |
| BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 | 5.42 | 7/12 | +0.037 | 0.620 | 0.799 | 0.564 | 0.628 | 0.709 | 0.592 | 0.670 | 0.778 |

## Chosen

| key | value |
|---|---|
| model | sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 |
| dimensions | 384 |
| cluster.join_threshold | 0.75 |
| cluster.merge_threshold | 0.88 |
| cluster.cohesion_floor | 0.60 |
| retrieve.min_similarity | 0.36 |
| client auto-recall threshold | 0.22 |

Not applied: the incumbent won, so config defaults are unchanged. The retrieve
floor derived here (0.36) would cut a true hit at 0.338, and nonhit_p99 (0.373)
exceeds hit_min, so the spec's threshold rule has no valid solution on this
corpus. bge-small was measured without its query instruction prefix.

Reasoning: no candidate beat the incumbent on both criteria — MiniLM has the
lowest mean_rank (1.42 vs 2.33 / 5.42 / 12.58) and the largest mean_gap
(+0.148), so the decision rule keeps `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and Task 6 becomes a
docs-only change. The surprise is bge-small: its absolute scores are
much higher across the board (hit_min 0.620) but so is its noise floor
(nonhit_p50 0.564, fact-fact p50 0.592), so the separation between a hit and
the rest of the corpus is *worse*, not better — high cosine values on a
CLS-pooled model are a compression of the range, not better retrieval.
msmarco-cos-v5 was the clear loser, badly missing two of the low-vocabulary-
overlap questions (rank 69 and rank 56). Note one quirk in the threshold
figures: the current `merge_threshold` of 0.90 sits above the maximum observed
fact-to-fact similarity (0.878) in this corpus, so the "same percentile"
mapping pins it to that maximum and the rule rounds it to 0.88 — the corpus
simply contains no pair similar enough to justify 0.90.

12. "how fast is memory lookup supposed to be" -> `fact:g8q5rwzz89m4dyidz21h`

## Second pass (2026-09-08, evening): query prefixes and nomic

Same 143-fact corpus (dumped from the 08:08 data copy) and the same 12 questions, run
through sentence-transformers on CPU instead of candle so that non-BERT architectures could
be tried without writing loaders. MiniLM and multi-qa reproduce the candle numbers exactly,
so the two paths are comparable. bge-small now carries its query instruction prefix; nomic
uses `search_query:` / `search_document:`. Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (596M params) and
embeddinggemma-300m (gated) were not run.

| model | dims | mean_rank | top1 | mean_gap | hit_min | hit_max | nonhit_p50 | nonhit_p90 | nonhit_p99 | ff_p50 | ff_p90 | ff_p99 | doc ms/text | query ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | 1.42 | 9/12 | +0.148 | 0.338 | 0.667 | 0.078 | 0.212 | 0.373 | 0.132 | 0.302 | 0.571 | 5.1 | 4.0 |
| sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 | 384 | 2.33 | 8/12 | +0.091 | 0.318 | 0.635 | 0.082 | 0.215 | 0.375 | 0.125 | 0.290 | 0.568 | 7.3 | 3.9 |
| BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (with query prefix) | 384 | 5.92 | 8/12 | +0.042 | 0.584 | 0.783 | 0.547 | 0.617 | 0.683 | 0.592 | 0.670 | 0.778 | 15.2 | 8.5 |
| nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5 | 768 | 5.67 | 7/12 | +0.036 | 0.588 | 0.803 | 0.544 | 0.603 | 0.663 | 0.639 | 0.705 | 0.806 | 71.2 | 24.4 |
| nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5 truncated to 384 | 384 | 4.17 | 8/12 | +0.038 | 0.575 | 0.805 | 0.537 | 0.603 | 0.660 | 0.637 | 0.705 | 0.804 | 72.0 | 23.8 |

Per-question rank (MiniLM / multi-qa / bge+prefix / nomic / nomic@384):

| q | ranks |
|---|---|
| 1 hooks going stale after git pull | 4 / 9 / 17 / 4 / 5 |
| 9 systemd status flag gotcha | 1 / 1 / 2 / 7 / 7 |
| 10 structured output wrapped in backticks | 1 / 1 / 1 / 3 / 5 |
| 11 very short strings disappearing | 2 / 5 / 20 / 45 / 25 |
| 12 how fast is memory lookup | 2 / 4 / 24 / 1 / 1 |
| all others | 1 across the board (q7 nomic 2, q4 multi-qa 2) |

Outcome: default unchanged. The query prefix did not help bge (mean rank 5.92 vs 5.42
without it). nomic is 6x the parameters, 14x the per-text latency, and still loses on
mean rank and separation; its noise floor (nonhit_p50 0.54, fact-fact p50 0.64) is as
compressed as bge's. Both larger models lose badly on the paraphrase-heavy question 11 and
bge on question 12, where MiniLM's keyword overlap carries it. The corpus is short
technical statements, and small mean-pooled MiniLM appears to be the right shape for it.
