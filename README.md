# Alexandria

Agent memory server with tiered maturity, hierarchical clustering, spreading activation, and progressive recall. Runs as a persistent [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) service backed by embedded [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/).

## Features

- **Semantic search** — Cosine similarity over local embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via candle, pure Rust)
- **Ebbinghaus heat model** — Memories have heat (recency) and stability (spaced repetition). Frequently accessed memories stay hot; forgotten ones cool.
- **Spreading activation** — Accessing a memory warms its graph neighbors. Heat propagates along edges with configurable decay.
- **Graph edges** — Memories link via `relates_to`, `supports`, `contradicts`, `derived_from`, and `extracted_from` edges
- **Hierarchical clustering** — Automatic cluster assignment on store, background split/merge maintenance
- **Progressive recall** — Two-phase retrieval: broad cluster matching first, then scope-narrowing within a cluster
- **Document import** — Chunk by heading, paragraph, or fixed size with batch tracking and `extracted_from` lineage
- **Persistent storage** — SurrealKV on disk, survives restarts
- **Schema migrations** — Versioned `.surql` files with forward-only migration runner

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and install
cargo install --path .

# Create config
mkdir -p ~/.config/alexandria
cat > ~/.config/alexandria/config.toml << 'EOF'
[server]
transport = "http"
port = 3000

[embedding]
model = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
device = "cpu"
EOF

# Run
alexandria
```

First run downloads the embedding model from HuggingFace Hub (~80MB).

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `store_memory` | Store text with auto-embedding, clustering, and heat initialization |
| `retrieve_memories` | Semantic similarity search with spreading activation on top results |
| `recall` | Progressive two-phase recall: broad cluster scan → focused scope narrowing |
| `update_memory` | Update content/tags/confidence; content changes re-embed and create lineage |
| `import_document` | Import and chunk documents with `extracted_from` edge tracking |
| `delete_memory` | Soft-delete a memory by ID |

### Getting agents to actually use memory

A memory server is only useful if agents reach for it unprompted. Alexandria nudges this at
three levels:

1. **MCP `instructions`** — the server advertises usage guidance (when to read vs. write memory)
   in its `initialize` response via `ServerInfo.instructions`. Any MCP-compliant client can surface
   this to the model. Tool descriptions are also written directively ("call this proactively
   whenever...") rather than just describing mechanics.
2. **Client-side skill** — [`contrib/pi/skills/alexandria-memory/`](contrib/pi/skills/alexandria-memory/)
   (Pi) and [`contrib/claude/skills/alexandria-memory/`](contrib/claude/skills/alexandria-memory/)
   (Claude Code) document concrete trigger conditions and tool choice guidance, mirroring how other high-usage
   MCP tools ship skills alongside themselves.
3. **Optional auto-recall extension** — [`contrib/pi/extensions/alexandria-auto-recall/`](contrib/pi/extensions/alexandria-auto-recall/)
   hooks `before_agent_start` to call `retrieve_memories` on every prompt automatically and inject
   hits above a similarity threshold into context, so the agent never has to decide to check
   memory. This trades latency and potential noise for guaranteed recall. The Claude Code
   equivalent is a `UserPromptSubmit` hook at
   [`contrib/claude/hooks/alexandria-recall.sh`](contrib/claude/hooks/alexandria-recall.sh).

Items 2 and 3 are client-side integrations, not part of the MCP server itself — see
[`contrib/pi/README.md`](contrib/pi/README.md) and [`contrib/claude/README.md`](contrib/claude/README.md)
for what they are and how to install them.

## Debug Web UI

When `transport = "http"`, a read-only debug web UI is served alongside the MCP endpoint at
`http://<host>:<port>/debug`:

- **Dashboard** (`/debug`) — live counts of facts, clusters, edges, and raw documents
- **Memories** (`/debug/memories`) — search/filter facts by content and tag; click through to a
  detail view showing heat, stability, cluster membership, and graph edges
- **Clusters** (`/debug/clusters`) — cluster list with live member counts and cohesion; drill into
  member facts
- **Graph** (`/debug/graph/:id`) — visualizes a memory's local edge neighborhood
- **Query Tester** (`/debug/query`) — run `retrieve_memories`/`recall` live against the real
  embedding model to sanity-check retrieval quality

The debug UI has **no authentication** and is intended for a trusted network boundary (same
posture as the unauthenticated MCP endpoint) — do not expose it on a public interface without
putting a reverse proxy/auth layer in front of it.

## Deployment

### As a systemd user service (recommended)

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/alexandria.service
[Unit]
Description=Alexandria Agent Memory MCP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.cargo/bin/alexandria
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
Environment=RUST_LOG=info,rmcp=warn

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

`rmcp=warn` drops the per-request transport chatter (~6 lines per call at `info`) while keeping Alexandria's own logs.

journald has no per-unit size cap, so bound the journal globally if you want to limit history:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/alexandria.conf
[Journal]
SystemMaxUse=200M
MaxRetentionSec=1month
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now alexandria
journalctl --user -u alexandria -f  # tail logs
```

### MCP client configuration

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user alexandria http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp
# optional: client-side skill (same as contrib/pi, with Claude Code's mcp__alexandria__<tool> names)
cp -r contrib/claude/skills/alexandria-memory ~/.claude/skills/
# optional: auto-recall hook (see contrib/claude/README.md for the settings.json snippet)
cp contrib/claude/hooks/alexandria-recall.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
```

**Generic (any MCP client):**

```json
{
  "alexandria": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp"
  }
}
```

Or via stdio (for single-session use):

```json
{
  "alexandria": {
    "command": "alexandria",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Config loads with precedence: defaults → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alexandria/config.toml` → `ALEXANDRIA_CONFIG` env → individual env vars. Data defaults to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/alexandria/data`.

Legacy `~/.alexandria/` paths are used as fallback if the XDG paths don't exist yet.

The Pi auto-recall/store extension has its own config at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alexandria/client.toml`.

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for all options, client config reference, and migration instructions.
